# Project Name

> Housing Prediction Advanced Linear Regression

### Project Information

> The project is a to build a model with regularisation (Ridge and Lasso) to predict the price of houses with the available independent variables.

### Project Statement

> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
